# üß† Anomaly Detection Platform ‚Äì Project Agenda & Vision

Welcome to the Anomaly Detection Platform built using an LSTM AutoEncoder with explainable and rule-based intelligence layers.

This project is designed to detect, explain, and escalate anomalies in time-series application metrics (e.g., throughput, response time, CPU, error count) with precision and adaptability.

## ‚úÖ What We've Implemented So Far

### 1. **Robust LSTM AutoEncoder for UX Anomaly Detection**
- Captures temporal patterns in application metrics
- Learns context-aware, multi-metric sequences (e.g., how CPU and response time trend together)
- Detects anomalies based on reconstruction error
- Sequence window size: 30 minutes (configurable)
- Output includes timestamp, error, anomaly flag, and real metric values

### 2. **Dynamic Thresholding with MAD**
- Uses Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) for robust, noise-resistant thresholding
- Adapts to data variability over time
- Improves anomaly precision while minimizing false positives

### 3. **Explainability Layer**
- Identifies top-contributing metric for each anomaly
- Produces human-readable explanations (e.g., ‚ÄúHigh deviation in 'Throughput'‚Äù)
- Enables faster root cause analysis

### 4. **Visual Output & Reporting**
- Line charts with anomaly overlays
- Top contributing metric summaries
- Reconstruction error plots for temporal trend analysis

## üí° Upcoming Enhancements (Planned)

### ‚úÖ 5. **Business Rule Framework (SLA-Aware)**
- Define business expectations (e.g., Response Time < 200ms during business hours)
- Attach SLA types and period types (e.g., batch window, off-hours)
- Map rule violations with or without anomalies

### ‚úÖ 6. **Configurable Rule Engine**
- YAML/JSON-based rule definition
- Easily editable for domain experts and business users
- Decouples business logic from codebase

### ‚úÖ 7. **Agentic Rule Execution (No-If Architecture)**
- Agent-based, natural language rule interpretation (e.g., via LangChain or ChatGPT)
- Execute rules without hard-coded `if` logic
- Self-adjusting policy enforcement engine for changing business needs
